    release is a instance of the chart

# tiller home
    tiller with its configmaps are on kube-system namespace

# how install tiller 
    when you download helm2 there are 2 binary files: helm and tiller 

helm uses the same conf of kubectl 

# helm init
    1- creates local working directory 
    2- install tiller on cluster

# uninstall tiller from kuber
    helm reset 

# helm security 
    tiller is on kube-system by default 
        so it uses the default service account in the namespace 
            so it is cluster admin 
    to solve this:
        service account + role + rolebinding 
    
    helm init --service-account ... --tiller-namespace ...

# tiller locally
    1- still the configmaps are saved on cluster
    2- $tiller -- listening on 44134
    3- helm init --client-only
    4- export HELM_HOME=/home/me/.helm
    5- export HELM_HOST=localhost:44134

# delete 
    helm2 delete --purge 
    deletes configmaps too

# managing configmaps 
    managing configmaps can be a hardship so 
    helm init --history-max 200

# delete completely 
    serverside -> helm reset 
    clientside -> rm -rf /home/me/.helm
