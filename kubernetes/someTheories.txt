# CRD Custom Resource Definition
    on kubernetes 1.7 > 
    enables users to add their own/custom objects to the kubernetes. and use it like any other native kubernetes objects.

# configfile 
    any user who wants to interact with cluster needs to have a configfile.
    ```kubeadm init``` creates a configfile under ```/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf```
    so we copy this file to user directory.

# flannel
    flannel is a overlay network
    pods on different nodes can comminucate over this like they are on a same nodes
    
# helm
    helm is kubernetes packet manager

# microk8s vs minikube
    micro: cluster on your machine
    minukube: cluster on VM 

# reach pods from outside
    hostNetwork: true  - for pod
    hostPort: true - for container
    loadbalancer:   cloud provider has to be enabled in the configs 
                    is plain TCP Round-Robin
                    kubernetes will create a seprate loadbalancer for each service so it is costly 
    ingress

# loadbalancer vs ingress
    LB : forwards to kube-proxy then pod
    ingress: forward to pod 

# multi containers pod 
    sharing same network stack and storage. so they can connect to each other by localhost
